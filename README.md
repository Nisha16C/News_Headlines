# News Headlines Web App

This code is a simple Python script that retrieves the top headlines from the News API and displays them in a Streamlit app. The app shows 20 headlines from the United States, but this can be customized by changing the parameters.

## Installation and Usage

To run this code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the `requests` and `streamlit` packages. You can install these packages by running the following command:

```
pip install requests streamlit
```

To run the app, simply execute the `app.py` file in your terminal by running the following command:

```
streamlit run app.py
```

## API Key

In order to use the News API, you will need to obtain an API key from the [News API website](https://newsapi.org/). Once you have your API key, replace the `NEWS_API_KEY` variable in the code with your own API key.
